## About

<p>The Quote of the they is small web app done by me in order to better understand API usage. It is fairly simple page influenced mostly by <a href="https://theultimateapichallenge.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ultimate API Challenge</a>. Because of the restriction of the official API, a number of requests is just 10 per hour.</p>

<p>For data fetching a XMLHttpRequest was used. On the official API page there is a boiler plate which I modified and also added some additional error handling cases.</p>

<p>Working app is deployed on Netlify and there is also a link for video presentation.</p>
